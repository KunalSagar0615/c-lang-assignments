The repository includes C programs such as:
- Basic input/output and arithmetic programs
- Conditional statements and looping constructs
- Functions and reusable code
- Arrays and string manipulation
- Pointers and memory handling
- Structures and file handling (if included)
- Logic-based problem solutions
